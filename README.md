I am moving my Java projects into Visual C# .NET. Try to compare to the Java version to find differences between 2 languages.  

All solutions created on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate 32-bit version, also fully tested on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.  

### Find Prime Number (via Sieve of Eratothenes)
**Note that in this solution you could learn how to deal with command argument and parse them to the program.**
- [CheckIndex](FindPrimeNumber/CheckIndex/CheckIndex.cs) - The code could print out the certain prime number with given index. Note that this code was modified to accept command argument. Run `CheckIndex 100` is same as input 100 when the program prompt without any argument.
- [FindPrimeNumber](FindPrimeNumber/FindPrimeNumber/CheckList.cs) - This could could print out a list of prime numbers from 2 to a certain number. Note that this code was modified to accept command argument. Run `CheckList 100` is same as input 100 when the program prompt without any argument.

### Fibonacci Sequence
**See the command help information, complie and run `FibonacciSequence -help` in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell. This package includes the method of creating a parameter-supported java program and exception handle statement.**
- [FibonacciSequence](FibonacciSequence/FibonacciSequence/Program.cs) - The main class.

### Monte Carlo Algorithms
**Use Monte Carlo Simulation to generate 1,000,000 random numbers to find the possible points on 5 dices.**
- [Dice.cs](MonteCarloAlgorithms/MonteCarloAlgorithms/Dice.cs) - The Dice object.
- [Program.cs](MonteCarloAlgorithms/MonteCarloAlgorithms/Program.cs) - The main class.

### AIB Datathon
**Analysis the most popular film in the given list and order them.**
- [Program.cs](AIBDatathon/AIBDatathon/Program.cs) - The main class.

### Stack Palindrome
**Check if a string is a palindrome through stack object.**
- [Program.cs](StackPalindrome/StackPalindrome/Program.cs) - The main class.

### Triangular Number
**Find the triangular number. Use `-help` to find more help.**
- [Program.cs](TriangularNumber/TriangularNumber/Program.cs) - The main class.

### Monte Carlo Simulation in Lottery
**Generate a 6-number sequence from 1 to 45 and predict the possibility of it appears consecutive pair.**
- [Program.cs](MonteCarlo_Lottery/MonteCarlo_Lottery/Program.cs) - The main class.

### Stick Problem
**Once again about Monte Carlo Simulation. This project is about a stick simulation. Break a stick randomly into 3 pieces, calculate the probability of form those 3 pieces into triangle.**
- [Program.cs](StickProblem/StickProblem/Program.cs) - The main class.
- [Stick.cs](StickProblem/StickProblem/Stick.cs) - The Stick class controls the operation of stick.

### Huffman Compression
**Check, Accumulate and Summarize the ASCII code in one string.**
- [Program.cs](HuffmanCompression/HuffmanCompression/Program.cs) - The main class.
